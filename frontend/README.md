# Deployment Go to reactApp directory

# RUN THIS FIRST....
* "npm run build" creates a build directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths like /static/js/main.hash.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.hash.js file. For more information see the production build section.

# Static Server#
For environments using Node, the easiest way to handle this would be to install serve and let it handle the rest:

# STEP1
 * npm install -g serve
# STEP2
 * serve -s build #with out port it will run on 5000
The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port 5000. Like many of serveâ€™s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the -l or --listen flags:

# STEP !2 3
 * serve -s build -l 3000
